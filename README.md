# Face Detection Using OpenCV

## Problem Statement
Face detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves identifying and locating human faces in images or video streams. This capability is crucial for various applications, including security systems, user interaction, and image analysis. The goal of this project is to implement an efficient and accurate face detection system using OpenCV.

## Libraries Used
- **OpenCV**: A popular open-source computer vision library that provides tools for image and video processing.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations that supports the handling of arrays and matrices, commonly used with OpenCV.

## Key Features
- Capable of processing both images and video streams.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces for visualization.
